in the 3rd month after the children of israel had come out of the land of egypt on this day they came to the wilderness of sinai
for they set out from rephidim and had come to the wilderness of sinai
and camped in the wilderness so israel camped there before the mountain
and moses went up to god and yahweh called to him from the mountain saying this is what you are to say to the house of jacob and declare to the children of israel
you have seen what I did to the egyptians
and how I bore you on eagles wings and brought you to myself
and now if you diligently obey my voice and shall guard my covenant then you shall be my treasured possession above all the peoples for all the earth is mine
and you shall be to me a reign of priests and a set apart nation those are the words which you are to speak to the children of israel
and mosheh came and called for the elders of the people and set before them all these words which yahweh commanded him
and all the people answered together and said, “All that יהוה has spoken we shall do.” So Mosheh brought back the words of the people to יהוה.
and yahweh said to moses see i am coming to you in the thick cloud so that the people hear when i speak with you and believe you forever
and moses reported the words of the people to yahweh
