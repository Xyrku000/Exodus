now in the 3rd month after the children of israel had come out of the land of egypt
on this day they came to the wilderness of sinai
and they set out from rephidim and had come to the wilderness of sinai
and israel camped there before the mountain
and moses went up onto the mountain of god
and god called him from the mountain saying
this is what you shall say to the house of jacob and declare to the sons of israel
    you have seen what I did to the egyptians
    and how I bore you on eagles wings
    and brought you to myself
    and now if you listen listen my voice
    and shall guard my covenant
    then you shall be my special possession above all the nations for all the earth is mine
    and you shall be to me a royal priesthood and a set apart nation
those are the words which you are to speak to the children of israel
and moses went and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words which god commanded him
and all the people answered with one accord
and said
    all that god has spoken we shall do and listen
now moses carried back the words of the people up to god
now yahweh said to moses
    see i am coming to you in a pillar of cloud so that the people hear when i speak with you and trust you forever
and moses reported the words of the people to yahweh
